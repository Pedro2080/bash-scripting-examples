## Technical assessment

1- Write a bash script that prints names of all files from the current directory which content (not name) does not contain any digit.

2- Write a script, which counts how many environment variables are defined in the system.

3- Write a script, which reads a file with numbers and finds a minimum, a maximum and a sum of values from the file. 
The numbers in the file must be placed in separated rows.
If the file is empty, then the proper message should be printed.

4- Write a script that takes three arguments: INPUT_FILE, OUTPUT_FILE1, OUTPUT_FILE2.
All even numbers from INPUT_FILE would be written to OUTPUT_FILE1 and odd numbers to OUTPUT_FILE2.
The script will display how many numbers are in both output files and how many words from the file were not a number.
